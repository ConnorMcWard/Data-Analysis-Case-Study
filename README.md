# Case Study Overview
**Background**

Cambio’s decarbonization platform utilizes artificial intelligence to retrofit buildings, helping our real estate customers achieve their net-zero goals. The foundation of Cambio’s platform is dynamic portfolio monitoring and benchmarking, which in turn relies upon consistent and accurate utility data from our customers.

**Instructions**

You have been provided with a dataset consisting of utility data similar to what we would receive from a Cambio customer, including information on natural gas and electricity consumption over the past year. Your task is to clean the dataset, implement checks to identify inaccuracies or data gaps, and help us make sense of the data.

**Detailed overview of tasks:**

1. **Data Cleaning:**
    - Prepare the dataset for analysis, addressing any data irregularities and ensuring data readiness. Explain how you handled any inaccuracies, inconsistencies, or gaps in the dataset.
    - Get the data into a usable structure and format (i.e. a clean database) for visualization and platform ingestion.
    - Feel free to use the method you’re most comfortable with to clean the data set (Excel, Python, etc.).
2. **Data Validation:**
    - Evaluate the quality and reliability of the utility data.
    - Identify any anomalies or outliers and make an initial attempt at normalization if possible.
3. **Carbon Emissions Analytics**
    - Convert the energy (electricity and gas) usage to carbon emissions (in metric tons).
    - For information on how to calculate the conversion, please see EnergyStar’s reference guide: https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/tools-and-resources/portfolio-manager-technical-reference-greenhouse-gas-emissions
4. **Data Visualization and Analysis:**
    - Create visualizations to represent key trends, patterns, and insights in the utility data.
    - Utilize appropriate visualization tools and techniques (e.g., charts, graphs) to enhance the understanding of the data.
    - Draw meaningful conclusions from the visualized data and incorporate them into the final report.
5. **Communication:**
    - Prepare a concise report summarizing findings and insights. What did you observe in the data provided? The report should include your methodology, the steps you took to complete the analysis,
    - Clearly communicate any issues identified and provide recommendations for further action by the Cambio customer success team.
